# Arrays and hashing

## Difficulties

### Easy

- Check Dom
- Contains Duplicate
- Find Index of the First Occurance in a String
- Length of Last Word
- Longest Common Prefix
- Plus One
- Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
- Remove Element
- Roman to Integer
- Two Sum
- String Encode and Decode
- Valid Anagram

### Medium

- Group Anagrams
- Longest Consecutive Sequence
- Product of Array Except Self
- Top K Frequent Elements
- Valid Sudoku

## Patterns

- Data stored in a **linear array**
- Requires **single pass or multiple passes**
- Frequent use of **hash map / dictionary**
- Frequent use of **hash set**
- Need to track **seen elements**
- Need to track **counts or frequencies**
- Need to track **indexes of elements**
- Asked to find **duplicates**
- Asked to find **missing elements**
- Asked to find **pairs or groups matching a condition**
- Asked to check **existence in O(1) time**
- Asked to find **first or last occurrence**
- Asked to group elements by **common property**
- Asked to check **anagrams**
- Asked to detect **cycles or repeats**
- Asked to find **longest / shortest subarray**
- Asked to compute **prefix sums**
- Asked to use **running totals**
- Asked to track **maximum or minimum so far**
- Asked to reduce **time complexity using extra space**
- Tradeoff between **space and time**
- Use of **two loops → optimize with hashing**
- Order **may or may not matter**
- Uses **index-based access**
- Uses **sliding window with hash map**
- Uses **constant-time lookups**
- Edge cases with **empty array or single element**
- Handling **negative numbers or zeros**
- Handling **large input sizes efficiently**
